<h1>Using private/closed repositories</h1>

<h2>Information about SSH keys</h2>

<p>In order to fetch the content from closed repositories, we need a SSH key which is authorized to retrieve the contents from such repositories.</p>

<p>As in the previous case, the SSH key is composed by a public and private part.</p>

<p>If do not have yet a SSH key, you can generate it by running the following command (make sure you have installed the <code>openssh-client</code> package):</p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa
</code></pre>

<p>This command will create two files in the <code>~/.ssh/</code> folder:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> file contains the private key.</li>

<li>the <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> file contains the public key.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Tip</em></p>

<p>Use <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> to print out the private key, and
<code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to print out the public key.</p>

<p>Make sure that this key has access to the repository. Different platforms have different ways of performing such step. For example, in GitHub you should go into the <i>Settings -> SSH and GPG keys</i> section, and add the new SSH key.</p>

<h2>Repository hostkey</h2>

<p>The Buildfarm also needs to know the <i>hostkey</i> of the server hosting the closed git repository.</p>

<p>To retrieve the hostkey for the server (e.g. <code>gitlab.mycompany.com</code>) run the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">ssh-keyscan gitlab.mycompany.com
</code></pre>

<p>The output will be similar to:</p>

<pre><code>gitlab.mycompany.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIA+bpD1Hf9LB+VFN6V6xdRsTi05gPHd0l7LhWbDZpAQM
</code></pre>

<p>Paste the full output of the command in the corresponding field below.</p>
