<h1>GPG Key</h1>

<p>The GPG key is used to sign the packages generated by the buildfarm and uploaded to the <em>repo</em>.</p>

<p>A GPG key has an identifier, a public, and a private part.</p>

<p>If you already have a GPG key, you can enter the information requested below. Otherwise you can generate a gpg key by running:</p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">gpg --gen-key
</code></pre>

<p>It is important that the gpg key's passphrase <strong>must be empty</strong>.</p>

<p>After running the key generation command and answering the questions, a message like the following one will be shown:</p>

<pre><code>gpg: key 8E19F126 marked as ultimately trusted
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>8E19F126</code> string is the identification string for the signing key.</p>

<p><em>Tip</em></p>

<p>Use <code>gpg --export-secret-keys -a [key_identifier]</code> to retrieve the private key, and <code>gpg --export -a [key_identifier]</code> to retrieve the public key.</p>
