<h1>SSH Hostkeys</h1>

<p>The <em>hostkey</em> identifies a host when connecting to it using SSH.</p>

<p>We need to specify here the hostkeys of the machines to which the agents will connect. Typically this means entering the hostkey of the <em>repo</em>, as the agents will connect to it to upload the generated packages.</p>

<p>The <em>documentation</em> host is also a typical example.</p>

<p>To retrieve the hostkey for the <em>repo</em> run the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">ssh-keyscan repo_hostname
</code></pre>

<p>The output will be similar to:</p>

<pre><code>repo ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIA+bpD1Hf9LB+VFN6V6xdRsTi05gPHd0l7LhWbDZpAQM
</code></pre>

<p>Paste the full output of the command here:</p>

<div class="input-group">
        {{ wtf.quick_form(form) }}
</div>
<br>
