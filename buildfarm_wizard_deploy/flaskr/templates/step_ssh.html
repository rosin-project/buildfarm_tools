<h1>SSH Keys</h1>

<p>We need a SSH key, which is composed by a public and private part.</p>

<p>This key will be used to copy the generated artifacts from the <em>slaves</em> to the <em>repo</em>.</p>

<p>If do not have yet a SSH key, you can generate it by running the following command (make sure you have installed the <code>openssh-client</code> package):</p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa
</code></pre>

<p>This command will create two files in the <code>~/.ssh/</code> folder:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> file contains the private key.</li>

<li>the <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> file contains the public key.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Tip</em></p>

<p>Use <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> to print out the private key, and
<code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to print out the public key.</p>
