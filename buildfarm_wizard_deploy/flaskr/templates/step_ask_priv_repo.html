<h1>Using private/closed repositories</h1>

<p>The Buildfarm will need to download the packages to be tested/deployed.
  Those packages are commonly hosted in Git repositories.
  If those repositories are not <i>open</i> i.e. they require credentials to clone or fetch their content, the Buildfarm needs to have registered these credentials.</p>
<p>If you are using such repositories to host your packages, choose "Yes" below.</p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">Are you planning on using packages that are hosted in repositories that require authentication?</div>
  </div>

<div>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="{{ url_for('step_ips') }}" role="button">No - continue with configuration &raquo;</a></p>
</div>

<div>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="{{ url_for('step_request_priv_repo') }}" role="button">Yes - set up authentication &raquo;</a></p>
