<h1>Buildfarm configuration wizard </h1>
<p>This is a simple web-based wizard to help setting the configuration for a ROS Buildfarm.
This will be performed by adjusting the content of your fork of the repository <a href="https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config">ros_buildfarm_config</a> </p>

<p> We assume that you have previously used the Buildfarm wizard, which generated a config file with all the information you provided.
We will be reusing most of these variables.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The configuration process aims at adjusting the content of the repository <a href="https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config">ros_buildfarm_config</a>.</p>

<h2>Assumption</h2>

We assume that:

<ul>
    <li> You already have prepared correctly your custom packages for being inserted into the buildfarm (if not, look <a href="{{ url_for('info_custom_packages') }}"> here</a>).</li>
    <li> You already have decided on the type of <code>rosdistro</code> to use (if not, look <a href="{{ url_for('info_rosdistro') }}"> here</a>).</li>
    <li>You have already launched the BuildFarm Wizard, and know where is the related configuration file.</li>
</ul>

<div>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="{{ url_for('step_input') }}" role="button">Start the wizard &raquo;</a></p>
</div>
