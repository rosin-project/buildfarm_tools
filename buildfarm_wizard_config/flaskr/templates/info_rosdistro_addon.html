<h3> Settings for rosdistro addon strategies</h3>

<p>
  You have selected one of the two add-on strategies.
  Some specific files are to be added to the rosdistro repository.
  This step is common for both strategies.
  The difference between the two add-on strategies only comes at the build initialization step.
</p>

<p> First of all you should create a fork of the official rosdistro, for adding your addon.</p>

<p>
  The Addon strategies require adding to the custom <code>rosdistro</code> repo
  a file describing the custom packages added to the standard distribution.
  The first step consists in referencing that file within the global file
  <a href="https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/index.yaml">index.html</a>.
  If we look at that file, we can see in it per ROS distribution the following text:
</p>


<pre>
<code class="yaml">
%YAML 1.1
# ROS index file
# see REP 143: http://ros.org/reps/rep-0143.html
---
distributions:
  [all ros distros]:
    ...
  kinetic:
    distribution: [kinetic/distribution.yaml]
    distribution_cache: http://repositories.ros.org/rosdistro_cache/kinetic-cache.yaml.gz
type: index
version: 3
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  In addition to the official ROS packages, we will create an additional file
  containing the list of our packages.
  For instance, if we focus on <code>kinetic</code>, we will create
  in the <code>kinetic</code> folder a new file, <code>addon_distribution.yaml</code>.
  We start referencing it in the <code>index.yaml</code> file, by extending the previous information to be:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="yaml">
  %YAML 1.1
  # ROS index file
  # see REP 143: http://ros.org/reps/rep-0143.html
  ---
  distributions:
    kinetic:
      distribution: [kinetic/distribution.yaml, kinetic/addon_distribution.yaml]
      distribution_cache: http://[repo_machine_ip]/rosdistro_cache/kinetic-cache.yaml.gz
  type: index
  version: 3
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  Note that we also changed the <code>distribution_cache</code> tag, to be the url
  of the repo machine, as described in the deploy wizard.
</p>
<p>
  Next step consists in filling the added file, <code>kinetic/addon_distribution.yaml</code> with the appropriate content.
  Similarly to the format used in the ditribution files of any ROS distribution, we describe there our additional packages
  (see the official <code>distribution.yaml</code> of <a href="https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/kinetic/distribution.yaml">kinetic</a> as an example).
  In the following example, we just add one package, named <code>basic_package</code>:
</p>

<pre>
<code class="yaml">
%YAML 1.1
# ROS distribution file
# see REP 143: http://ros.org/reps/rep-0143.html
---
release_platforms:
  ubuntu:

  basic_package:
    doc:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/wherever/basic_package.git
      version: kinetic-devel

      tags:

      url: https://github.com/wherever/basic_package.git
      version: kinetic-devel
    status: maintained
tags:
- custom
type: distribution
version: 2
</code>
</pre>

<p>In the previous file, it is important to set the tag information:</p>
<pre>
<code class="yaml">
tags:
- custom
type: distribution
version: 2
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  This tag value (here set to <code>custom</code>) will be used later on within the configuration of the jobs.
