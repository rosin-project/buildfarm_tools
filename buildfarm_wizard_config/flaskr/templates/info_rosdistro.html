<h2>rosdistro definition</h2>

The <code>rosdistro</code> defines all packages that will be included in your ROS distribution.
The definition of the rosdistro is done in a dedicated repository.
The official one is at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/index.yaml">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/index.yaml</a>,
within the repository <a href="https://github.com/ros/rosdistro">https://github.com/ros/rosdistro</a>.</p>

<p> Three main options arise (see <a href="https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm/blob/master/doc/custom_rosdistro.rst"> the official documentation</a> for more details):</p>

<ol>
    <li> <a href="#full fork">Make a full fork</a></li>
    <li><a href="#addon freeze">Add-on fork with frozen official ROS packages</a> </li>
    <li><a href="#addon rosdep">Add-on fork with official ROS packages handled through rosdep</a></li>
</ol>

<div id="full fork">
<h3>Full fork</h3>

<p>You can create arbitrary distributions and the custom build farm is responsible to build all packages on its own.</p>

<ul>
    <li> Pro: you have full control on what will contain your own distro</li>
    <li> Cons: you will spend a lot (I mean a lot) of time generating debians of official packages.
</ul>

<p>In that case, you would not rely on the official <code>ros_distro</code>, but will define your own one.</p>

<p> Note that appart your personal packages, you should also include all the ROS packages you rely on.</p>
</div>

<p>If the full fork is considered, the whole rosdistro repository is to be adjusted to your specific needs.</p>


<h3>Add-on strategy</h3>

<p> The two other strategies rely on the <code>add-on fork</code>.
The fork only adds an additional distribution files (beside the one defined in the official rosdistro repository).
This approach keeps using the packages generated by the official ROS build farm and only processes the additional custom packages / repositories.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pro: you can focus on your custom packages</li>
    <li>Cons: You have to decide which respect to which official ROS version you generate your solution.</li>
</ul>

<div id="addon freeze">
<h4>Add-on fork, freezing ROS packages</h4>

<p>Once the buildfarm deployed, after having installed the basic ROS package, an extra step is required for downloading relevant ROS package from the official repositories.
All building processes taking place in the buildfarm process will be done using these downloaded packages.</p>

<p>It is at your charge to decide when to update the official ROS packages by redoing this operation.</p>
</div>

<div id="addon rosdep">
<h4>Add-on fork, using rosdep</h4>

<p>In that configuration the official ROS debians are not downloaded at a fixed time.
They are indeed recovered from the official repositories every time the buildfarm prepares the workspace for building a package and get the dependencies through the rosdep mechanism.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pro: the packages are always built using the latest version of the official ROS packages.</li>
    <li>Cons: the built packages rely on external repositories, that may have different frequency of updates.</li>
</ul>
